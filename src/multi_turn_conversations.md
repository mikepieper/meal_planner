[Detailed meal plan with all items added to state]

## Conversation 4: Error Handling and Clarification

### Turn 1
**User**: "Add bacon to breakfast"

**State Before**: 
- `user_profile.dietary_restrictions`: ["vegetarian"]
- `breakfast`: [Greek yogurt bowl items]

**Flow**:
1. Agent reasoning: Conflict - user is vegetarian but requesting bacon
2. Agent doesn't call add_meal_item due to restriction
3. Agent responds to clarify

**Agent**: "I notice you mentioned you're vegetarian earlier, but bacon is a meat product. Would you like me to:
1. Add vegetarian bacon/tempeh bacon instead
2. Remove the vegetarian restriction from your profile
3. Skip adding bacon and suggest other protein-rich additions?

What would you prefer?"

---

### Turn 2
**User**: "Oh right! Add tempeh bacon instead, 2 strips"

**Flow**:
1. Agent calls `add_meal_item("breakfast", "tempeh bacon", "2", "strips")`
2. Command updates breakfast list

**Agent**: "Perfect! I've added 2 strips of tempeh bacon to your breakfast. This adds about 80 calories and 8g of plant-based protein, bringing your breakfast totals to approximately 530 calories and 33g protein. 

Your breakfast is now quite protein-rich! Ready to plan the rest of your day?"

## Identified High-Level Improvements

Based on these conversation examples, here are the key improvements needed:

### 1. **State Persistence Issues**
- Need better handling of `user_profile` updates (currently not using Commands)
- Should track conversation context better (what meals were suggested, user preferences shown)

### 2. **Conversation Context Memory**
- Agent should remember what options it presented (e.g., the 3 breakfast options)
- Need to track partial information given across turns

### 3. **Smarter Meal Plan Generation**
- `generate_meal_plan` should respect existing meals (not override them)
- Need ability to generate remaining meals only

### 4. **Nutritional Intelligence**
- Tools should validate against dietary restrictions before adding
- Need running nutrition totals accessible without calling analyze tools

### 5. **Tool Efficiency**
- Many sequential `add_meal_item` calls could be batched
- Need `add_multiple_meal_items` tool or similar

### 6. **User Profile Management**
- Profile updates happen outside Command pattern (direct assignment)
- Need tools for profile management

### 7. **Conversation Flow**
- Agent could be more proactive about next steps
- Should track what phase of planning user is in

### 8. **Error Recovery**
- Need better handling when LLM fails to parse meal plan JSON
- Should gracefully handle conflicting dietary restrictions

### 9. **Meal Suggestions Memory**
- When user selects "Option 1", agent should remember exact details
- Avoid re-describing items already presented

### 10. **Shopping List Integration**
- Should automatically suggest generating shopping list when plan is complete
- Track what items user already has vs. needs to buy
